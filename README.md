# flopp/aoc2016

My solutions for the awesome [Advent Of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016) - an advent calendar for programmers.

All of my solutions are written in C++, additionally I gave other languages (AWK, Tcl) a try on some days.

The solution of each day typically consists of two C++ files `main1.cpp` and `main2.cpp` which contain the code for part 1 and 2, as well as a `Makefile` to compile and run the solutions.

```sh
cd 06/c++

# compile and run test cases and the main puzzle of part 1
make test1
make puzzle1

# compile and run test cases and the main puzzle of part 2
make test2
make puzzle2
```
